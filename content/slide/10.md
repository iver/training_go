  ## What is it?
]
.right-column[
  Is a software development process that emerged from test-driven development (TDD).

- It is a bridge between business language (User Stories) and automatic tests.

- In practice, behavior-driven development may be similar to test-driven development.

- When all stakeholders have programming knowledge and skills.

- Test specification should be written in business friendly form.

- Describe behaviors in a single notation which is directly accessible to domain experts, testers and developers, so as to improve communication.

.right-column[
Teams already using TDD or ATDD may want to consider BDD for several reasons:

- BDD offers more precise guidance on organizing the conversation between developers, testers and domain experts

- Tools targeting a BDD approach generally afford the automatic generation of technical and end user documentation from BDD "specifications"

Here are a common golang frameworks:

* GoSpec (https://github.com/orfjackal/gospec)
* Ginkgo (https://onsi.github.io/ginkgo/)
* Gomega (https://onsi.github.io/gomega/)
* Goblin (https://github.com/franela/goblin)

        c.Specify("The first two Fibonacci numbers are 0 and 1", func() {
                c.Expect(fib[0], Equals, 0)
                c.Expect(fib[1], Equals, 1)
